This subalias helps users to where they need to go to generate JSONs for setting up imports.

## Location Import
[Location Generator](https://shadow-draconic-development.github.io/Weather-Management-System---Redux/city.html) is where you go in order to generate settings for individual locations.

## General Settings Import
[Settings Generator](https://shadow-draconic-development.github.io/Weather-Management-System---Redux/index.html) is where you go in order to generate general settings for all locations.

## Usage
For both locations and general settings, you simply setup the settings on the website, click "Generate JSON" and then copy and paste the output to be used by the `location` and `settings` subaliases.
